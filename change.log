Added movieInfo(String movie) which takes in the filename with extension 
and calls the script checkMovieInfo.sh

checkMovieInfo.sh takes in the file name as a parameter and checks to see
if a .mvinfo file exists.  If not, it calls the findmovie script and gets
the movie info, then cats it out.  If the file does exist it just cats it
Currently works fine with command line but not in the program.

Grabing the movie info works from the GUI now, but only if logged in as 
root.

Grabbing user info now works without root.  User that logs into the remote
must be part of the group that is allowed to create files in movie folders.
